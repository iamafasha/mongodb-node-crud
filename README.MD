#More documentation 

#MongoDB 

This is a an document model database(NoSQL) and stores data in form of Objects like JSON 

we will use community edition so we can host it ourselves. Here is the link to the documentation we are referring to as we use it https://docs.mongodb.com/manual


#NodeJs 
##What is node 
Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications.

Copied boilerplate from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Node_server_without_framework.
